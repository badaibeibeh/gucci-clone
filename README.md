# Gucci Clone
In the begining of my coding bootcamp. I studied about HTML & CSS in the class. And then i got a homework to create a page using html & css. I was choosing in-line css because I thought its more simple. Now I know using in-line css its not recomended. So this is my 1st exercise to learn html &amp; css
